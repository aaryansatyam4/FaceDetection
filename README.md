Certainly! Here's a PDF version of the README content for your FaceDetection project:

Face Detection and Identification using OpenCV and C++

Overview:
This project implements real-time face detection and identification using OpenCV and C++. It utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and template matching for identification against reference images.

Installation:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/aaryansatyam4/FaceDetection.git
cd FaceDetection

Build the project:

bash

    g++ -o face_detection main.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`

    Ensure OpenCV 4.x is installed. If not, follow the official OpenCV installation guide.

Usage:

    Connect your webcam and run the executable:

    bash

    ./face_detection

    The application will open a window displaying live video from your webcam. Detected faces will be outlined with rectangles.

    Press 'q' to exit the application.

Customization:

    Changing Reference Images: Replace aryan.jpg and aryan2.jpg with your own reference images in main.cpp.
    Adjusting Thresholds: Fine-tune the identification thresholds (threshold1 and threshold2 variables) in main.cpp based on your specific requirements.
